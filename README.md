# Selenium Property Data Matching Project

This project automates the verification of property details (title, price, type, rating, reviews) on a property listing website. It checks the consistency of these details across multiple views: the property tile, the map info window, and the detail page.

## Features
- Extracts property data from tiles, map popups, and detailed property pages.
- Compares extracted data and generates a report of the test results.
- Uses random dynamic URLs for location-based property searches.
- Handles dynamic locators stored in an external configuration file.
- Implements a modular design for scalability and ease of maintenance.
- Uses Faker for generating random location data.
- Logs test execution and errors for easier debugging.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome
- Chromedriver compatible with your Chrome version

### Installing Chromedriver

1. Check your Chrome version by navigating to `chrome://settings/help`.
2. Download the matching Chromedriver from the official site: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
3. Extract the downloaded archive.
4. Add the Chromedriver executable to your system PATH or specify the full path in `driver_setup.py`.

#### On Linux:
```bash
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/<version>/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
```

#### On Windows:
1. Extract `chromedriver_win32.zip`.
2. Place `chromedriver.exe` in a folder (e.g., `C:\chromedriver\`).
3. Add this folder to your system's PATH variable or update the path in the `setup_driver()` function.

## Setting Up
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/samiya1859/selenium_assignment2.git
   cd selenium_assignment2
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project
To execute the tests and generate a report:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will dynamically generate a location-based URL, traverse property data, and save the results in an Excel report.

## Configuration
- **config/config.py** contains the base URL prefix and other constants used for constructing dynamic URLs.
- **utils/locator_reader.py** reads locators from an external file for flexibility in locator management.

## Dynamic URL Checking
The project uses a loop to continuously check page layouts until a valid one is found. The process involves:
- Generating a random city name using `Faker`.
- Constructing a URL: `https://www.petfriendly.io/all/<random-city>/`.
- Checking the `window.ScriptData.pageLayout` value using JavaScript:
  - If layout is `"Error"`, a new URL is generated.
  - If layout is `"category"`, the tests proceed.

Example implementation in `check_page_layout.py`:
```python
page_layout = driver.execute_script("return window.ScriptData.pageLayout")
```

## Logging and Error Handling
- Logging is configured using Pythonâ€™s `logging` module.
- Errors and retries are logged for better traceability.

Example logging configuration:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

## Test Flow
1. **Dynamic URL Generation**: A random city is selected, and a URL is constructed.
2. **URL Layout Check**: Loop until a valid layout is found.
3. **Data Extraction**: Property details are extracted from tiles and detail pages.
4. **Validation**: Consistency checks are performed between tiles, map info, and details pages.

## Generating Test Reports
Test results are saved in an Excel file:
- **utils/generate_excel.py** handles Excel report creation.
- The output includes test case results with status and comments.


## Test Data Report
The `generate_excel.py` script creates an Excel file summarizing the test results:
- `Key`: Unique identifier for each test.
- `URL`: Tested location-based URL.
- `Page`: Category page.
- `Test Case`: Data matching comparison.
- `Passed`: Boolean result.
- `Comments`: Detailed comparison outcomes.

## Future Enhancements
- Additional browser support.
- Expanded property data fields for verification.
- Parallel testing for improved performance.
